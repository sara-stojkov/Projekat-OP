# Python Cinema App with Console Interface

### Overview
A Python project done as part of "Fundamentals of Programming" course. The main idea was to grasp the basic concepts needed for any project or app, such as handling and storing data, dividing the problem into subproblems etc. Since this is my first _bigger_ programming project, I am aware it has its flaws - although it managed to meet all of the project requirements.
#### Technlogies
- Python 3
- Pretty tables library (for better console output)

### Specifications
" Make a Python app for handling ticket sales in a cinema. The app can be used bz unregistered, registered users, employees and managers. In short, the app handles logging in and out, searching for movie projections, searching for movies, making seat reservations, searching through sold tickets as well as some reports for the managers.
